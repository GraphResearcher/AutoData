        "ABSTRACT": "Selecting  a good  model of a set  of input points by  cross  validation  is  a  computationally intensive  process,  especially  if the  number of  possible  models  or  the  number  of training  points  is  high.  Tech(cid:173) niques  such  as  gradient  descent  are  helpful  in  searching  through  the space of models,  but problems such  as  local minima, and more  importantly, lack  of a  distance  metric  between  various  models re(cid:173) duce  the applicability of these search  methods.  Hoeffding  Races  is  a  technique  for  finding  a  good  model  for  the  data by  quickly  dis(cid:173) carding bad models, and concentrating the computational effort  at  differentiating between  the better  ones.  This paper focuses  on  the  special  case  of leave-one-out  cross  validation  applied  to  memory(cid:173) based  learning  algorithms,  but  we  also  argue  that  it is  applicable  to any  class  of model selection  problems.",

        "ABSTRACT": "Integrated  Mean  Squared  Error  (IMSE)  is  a  version  of the  usual  mean  squared  error  criterion,  averaged  over  all  possible  training  If it  could  be  observed,  it  could  be  used  sets  of  a  given  size.  to  determine  optimal  network  complexity  or  optimal  data  sub(cid:173) sets for  efficient  training.  We  show  that two  common methods of  cross-validating  average  squared  error  deliver  unbiased  estimates  of IMSE,  converging  to  IMSE  with  probability  one.  These  esti(cid:173) mates thus make possible  approximate IMSE-based  choice  of net(cid:173) work complexity.  We also show that two variants of cross validation  measure provide unbiased IMSE-based estimates potentially useful  for  selecting optimal data subsets. \n1  Summary  To  begin,  assume  we  are  given  a  fixed  network  architecture.  (We  dispense  with  this  assumption  later.)  Let  zN  denote  a  given  set  of N  training  examples.  Let  QN(zN) denote the expected squared error  (the expectation taken over all possible  examples) of the network  after  being trained on  zN.  This measures  the  quality of  fit  afforded by  training on  a  given set of N  examples.  Let  IMSEN  denote  the  Integrated  Mean  Squared  Error  for  training  sets  of size  N.  Given  reasonable  assumptions,  it  is  straightforward  to  show  that  IMSEN  =  E[Q N(ZN)] - 0\"2,  where  the expectation is  now  over  all training sets of size  N,  ZN  is  a  random training set of size  N, and 0\"2  is the noise variance.  Let  CN  = CN(zN)  denote  the  \"delete-one  cross-validation\"  squared  error  measure  for  a network  trained on zN.  CN  is obtained by training networks on each of the N  training sets of size N -1 obtained by deleting a single example; the measure follows",

Human  communication,  whether  given  as  text,  handwriting,  or  speech,  has  multi  characteristic  time  scales.  On  short  scales  it  is  characterized  mostly  by  the  dynamics  that  gen(cid:173) erate  the  process,  whereas  on  large  scales,  more syntactic  and  se(cid:173) mantic information is  carried.  For  that  reason  the  conventionally  used  fixed  memory  Markov  models  cannot  capture  effectively  the  complexity of such structures.  On the other hand using long mem(cid:173) ory  models uniformly is  not  practical  even  for  as  short memory as  four.  The  algorithm  we  propose  is  based  on  minimizing  the  sta(cid:173) tistical  prediction  error  by  extending  the  memory, or state length,  adaptively, until the total prediction error  is  sufficiently small.  We  demonstrate the algorithm by learning the structure of natural En(cid:173) glish  text  and applying the learned  model to the correction  of cor(cid:173) rupted  text .  Using  less  than  3000  states  the  model's  performance  is  far  superior  to  that  of fixed  memory models  with  similar num(cid:173) ber  of states.

        "ABSTRACT": "We prove that the so called \"loading problem\" for (recurrent) neural net(cid:173) works is unsolvable.  This extends several results which already demon(cid:173) strated that training and related design problems for neural networks are  (at least)  NP-complete.  Our result also implies  that it is impossible  to  find  or to  formulate  a  universal training  algorithm,  which  for  any  neu(cid:173) ral  network  architecture could determine a  correct set of weights.  For  the  simple proof of this,  we  will just show  that the loading  problem  is  equivalent to \"Hilbert's tenth problem\" which is known to be unsolvable. \n1  THE NEURAL NETWORK MODEL \nIt seems that there are relatively few  commonly accepted general formal  definitions of the  notion  of a  \"neural  network\".  Although  our results also  hold  if based on  other formal  definitions  we  will  try  to  stay here  very  close  to  the original  setting  in  which Judd's NP  completeness result was given [Judd,  1990].  But in  contrast to  [Judd,  1990]  we will  deal  here with simple recurrent networks instead of feed forward architectures. \nOur networks  are constructed from  three different types  of units:  .E-units compute just  the sum of all incoming signals; for II -units the activation (node) function is given by the  product of the incoming signals; and with E)-units - depending if the input signal is smaller  or larger than  a certain  threshold parameter fl  - the output is  zero or one.  Our units are  connected or linked by real weighted connections and operate synchronously. \nNote that we could base our construction also just on  one general  type of units,  namely  what usually is called .E II -units.  Furthermore, one could replace the II -units in the below",

        "ABSTRACT": "This paper presents  a simple algorithm to learn trajectories with a  continuous  time,  continuous  activation  version  of the  Boltzmann  machine.  The  algorithm  takes  advantage  of intrinsic  Brownian  noise in the network to easily compute gradients using entirely local  computations.  The  algorithm may  be  ideal  for  parallel hardware  implementations. \nThis  paper  presents  a  learning  algorithm to train  continuous stochastic  networks  to  respond  with  desired  trajectories  in  the  output  units  to  environmental  input  trajectories.  This is a task, with potential applications to a variety of problems such  as stochastic modeling of neural processes,  artificial motor control,  and continuous  speech  recognition .  For  example,  in  a  continuous speech  recognition  problem,  the  input trajectory  may be  a  sequence  of fast  Fourier  transform coefficients,  and  the  output  a  likely  trajectory  of phonemic  patterns  corresponding  to  the  input.  This  paper was based on recent  work on diffusion networks by Movellan and McClelland  (in  press)  and  by  recent  papers  by  Apolloni  and  de  Falco  (1991)  and  Neal  (1992)  on  asymmetric  Boltzmann  machines.  The  learning  algorithm  can  be  seen  as  a  generalization of their work  to  the stochastic  diffusion  case  and  to  the problem of  learning continuous stochastic trajectories. \nDiffusion networks are governed by the standard connectionist differential equations  plus  an  independent  additive  noise  component.

        "AUTHORS": "Andreas S. Weigend",
        "ABSTRACT": "This  workshop  explored  machine  learning  approaches  to  3  topics:  (1)  finding structure in  music (analysis,  continuation, and comple(cid:173) tion  of an  unfinished  piece),  (2)  modeling  perception  of time  (ex(cid:173) traction  of musical meter,  explanation of human  data on  timing),  and  (3)  interpolation in  timbre space. \nIn  recent  years,  NIPS  has  heard  neural  networks  generate  tunes  and  harmonize  chorales.  With  a  large  amount of music  becoming available  in  computer  readable  form,  real  data  can  be  used  to  train  connectionist  models.  At  the  beginning  of  this  workshop,  Andreas  Weigend focused  on  architectures  to  capture  structure  on  multiple  time scales.  J.  S.  Bach's  last  (unfinished)  fugue  from  Die  Kunst  der  Fuge  served  as  an  example (Dirst  &  Weigend,  1994).1  The prediction  approach  to  continuation  and  completion,  as  well  as  to  modeling expectations,  can  be  charac(cid:173) terized  by  the  question  \"What's  next?\".  Moving  to  time  as  the  primary  medium  of musical communication, the inquiry in music perception  and cognition shifted to  the question  \"When next?\" .  In other words, so far we  have considered patterns  in  time.  They assume prior iden(cid:173) tification and subsequent  processing  of events.  Bob Port, coming from  the speech  community, considered patterns of time, discussing timing in linguistic polyrhythms  (e.g.,  hot  cup  of tea).  He  also  drew  parallels  between  timing in  Japanese  language  and timing in  music,  supporting the hypothesis  that perceptional  rhythms entrain  attentional rhythms.  As  a mechanism for entrainment, Devin McAuley presented  adaptive oscillators:  the oscillators adapt  their  frequencies  such  that  their  \"firing\"  coincides  with the  beat of the music (McAuley,  1994). \nAs  the  beat  can  be  viewed  as  entrainment  of  an  individual  oscillator,  the  meter  can  be  viewed  as  entrainment of multiple oscillators.  Ed  Large described  human  perception of metrical structure in analogy to two pendulum clocks that synchronize  their  motions  by  hanging  on  the  same  wall.  An  advantage  of these  entrainment \n1 This fugue is  available  via anonymous ftp from  ftp. santafe. edu as data set F. dat of \nthe Santa  Fe  Time Series  Analysis  and  Prediction  Competition.",

        "ABSTRACT": "Functional complexity of a software module can be measured in  terms of static complexity metrics of the program text. Classify(cid:173) ing software modules, based on their static complexity measures,  into different fault-prone categories is a difficult problem in soft(cid:173) ware engineering. This research investigates the applicability of  neural network classifiers for identifying fault-prone software mod(cid:173) ules using a data set from a commercial software system. A pre(cid:173) liminary empirical comparison is performed between a minimum  distance based Gaussian classifier, a perceptron classifier and a  multilayer layer feed-forward network classifier constructed using  a modified Cascade-Correlation algorithm. The modified version  of the Cascade-Correlation algorithm constrains the growth of the  network size by incorporating a cross-validation check during the  output layer training phase. Our preliminary results suggest that  a multilayer feed-forward network can be used as a tool for iden(cid:173) tifying fault-prone software modules early during the development  cycle. Other issues such as representation of software metrics and  selection of a proper training samples are also discussed.",

        "ABSTRACT": "We show how an \"Elman\" network architecture, constructed from  recurrently connected oscillatory associative memory network mod(cid:173) ules, can employ selective \"attentional\" control of synchronization  to direct the flow of communication and computation within the  architecture to solve a grammatical inference problem.  Previously we have shown how the discrete time \"Elman\" network  algorithm can be implemented in a network completely described  by continuous ordinary differential equations. The time steps (ma(cid:173) chine cycles) of the system are implemented by rhythmic variation  (clocking) of a bifurcation parameter. In this architecture, oscilla(cid:173) tion amplitude codes the information content or activity of a mod(cid:173) ule (unit), whereas phase and frequency are used to \"softwire\" the  network. Only synchronized modules communicate by exchang(cid:173) ing amplitude information; the activity of non-resonating modules  contributes incoherent crosstalk noise.  Attentional control is modeled as a special subset of the hidden  modules with ouputs which affect the resonant frequencies of other  hidden modules. They control synchrony among the other mod(cid:173) ules and direct the flow of computation (attention) to effect transi(cid:173) tions between two subgraphs of a thirteen state automaton which  the system emulates to generate a Reber grammar. The internal  crosstalk noise is used to drive the required random transitions of  the automaton.",

TPDP  does  so  by  determining  an  ideal  set  of transition  points  (TPs)  which  specify only  the  control  action  changes  necessary  for  optimal  control.  TPDP  converges  to  an ideal TP set by using a variation of Q-Iearning to assess the mer(cid:173) its of adding,  swapping and  removing TPs from  states throughout  the  state  space.  When  applied  to  a  race  track  problem,  TPDP  learned  the optimal  control  policy  much  sooner  than  conventional  Q-Iearning,  and was  able  to do so using  less  memory.",

        "ABSTRACT": "We describe the relationship between certain reinforcement learn(cid:173) ing (RL) methods based on dynamic programming (DP) and a class  of unorthodox Monte Carlo methods for solving systems of linear  equations proposed in the 1950's. These methods recast the solu(cid:173) tion of the linear system as the expected value of a statistic suitably  defined over sample paths of a Markov chain. The significance of  our observations lies in arguments (Curtiss, 1954) that these Monte  Carlo methods scale better with respect to state-space size than do  standard, iterative techniques for solving systems of linear equa(cid:173) tions. This analysis also establishes convergence rate estimates.  Because methods used in RL systems for approximating the evalu(cid:173) ation function of a fixed control policy also approximate solutions  to systems of linear equations, the connection to these Monte Carlo  methods establishes that algorithms very similar to TD algorithms  (Sutton, 1988) are asymptotically more efficient in a precise sense  than other methods for evaluating policies. Further, all DP-based  RL methods have some of the properties of these Monte Carlo al(cid:173) gorithms, which suggests that although RL is often perceived to  be slow, for sufficiently large problems, it may in fact be more ef(cid:173) ficient than other known classes of methods capable of producing  the same results.",

        "ABSTRACT": "While exploring to find better solutions, an agent performing on(cid:173) line reinforcement learning (RL) can perform worse than is accept(cid:173) able. In some cases, exploration might have unsafe, or even catas(cid:173) trophic, results, often modeled in terms of reaching 'failure' states  of the agent's environment. This paper presents a method that uses  domain knowledge to reduce the number of failures during explo(cid:173) ration. This method formulates the set of actions from which the  RL agent composes a control policy to ensure that exploration is  conducted in a policy space that excludes most of the unacceptable  policies. The resulting action set has a more abstract relationship  to the task being solved than is common in many applications of  RL. Although the cost of this added safety is that learning may  result in a suboptimal solution, we argue that this is an appropri(cid:173) ate tradeoff in many problems. We illustrate this method in the  domain of motion planning. \n\"'This work was done while the first author was finishing his Ph.D in computer science \nat the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",

In this paper we use  two radial basis function networks: one as a model of an unknown  plant and the other as the controller. The controller is trained  with a recurrent learning algorithm to minimize a novel objective  function such that the controller can locate an unstable fixed point  and drive the system into the fixed point with no a priori knowl(cid:173) edge of the system dynamics. Our results indicate that the neural  controller offers many advantages over OGY's technique.",

        "ABSTRACT": "The performance requirements in experimental research on arti(cid:173) ficial neural nets often exceed the capability of workstations and  PCs by a great amount. But speed is not the only requirement.  Flexibility and implementation time for new algorithms are usually  of equal importance. This paper describes the simulation of neural  nets on the MUSIC parallel supercomputer, a system that shows a  good balance between the three issues and therefore made many  research projects possible that were unthinkable before. (MUSIC  stands for Multiprocessor System with Intelligent Communication) \n1 Overview of the MUSIC System \nThe goal of the MUSIC project was to build a fast parallel system and to use it in  real-world applications like neural net simulations, image processing or simulations  in chemistry and physics [1, 2]. The system should be flexible, simple to program  and the realization time should be short enough to not have an obsolete system by  the time it is finished. Therefore, the fastest available standard components were  used. The key idea of the architecture is to support the collection and redistribution  of complete data blocks by a simple, efficient and autonomously working commu(cid:173) nication network realized in hardware. Instead of considering where to send data  and where from to receive data, each processing element determines which part of  a (virtual) data block it has produced and which other part of the same data block  it wants to receive for the continuation of the algorithm.",

        "ABSTRACT": "I  detail  the  design  and construction  of an  analog  VLSI  model  of the  neural system responsible for swimming behaviors of the leech.  Why  the  leech?  The  biological  network  is  small  and  relatively  well  understood,  and  the  silicon  model  can  therefore  span  three  levels  of  organization in  the leech nervous system (neuron, ganglion, system); it  represents  one of the first comprehensive models of leech  swimming  operating in  real-time.  The circuit employs  biophysically  motivated  analog neurons networked to form  multiple biologically inspired silicon  ganglia.  These  ganglia  are  coupled  using  known  interganglionic  connections.  Thus  the  model  retains  the  flavor  of  its  biological  counterpart, and  though  simplified,  the output of the  silicon circuit is  similar to  the output of the leech swim central pattern generator.  The  model operates on the same time- and spatial-scale as the leech nervous  system  and  will  provide an  excellent platform  with  which  to  explore  real-time  adaptive  locomotion  in  the  leech  and  other  \"simple\"  invertebrate nervous systems.",

        "ABSTRACT": "MacKay's Bayesian framework for  backpropagation is  conceptually  appealing  as  well  as  practical.  It automatically adjusts the  weight  decay  parameters  during  training,  and  computes  the  evidence  for  each  trained  network.  The  evidence  is  proportional  to  our  belief  in  the  model.  The  networks  with  highest  evidence  turn  out  to  generalise well.  In this paper, the framework is extended to pruned  nets,  leading  to  an  Ockham  Factor  for  \"tuning  the  architecture  to  the  data\".  A  committee  of networks,  selected  by  their  high  evidence,  is  a  natural  Bayesian  construction.  The  evidence  of a  committee is computed.  The framework is illustrated on real-world  data from  a  near  infrared  spectrometer  used  to determine  the fat  content  in  minced  meat.  Error  bars  are  computed,  including  the  contribution from the  dissent  of the committee members. \n1  THE OCKHAM  FACTOR \nWilliam  of  Ockham's  (1285-1349)  principle  of economy  in  explanations,  can  be  formulated as follows: \nIf several theories  account  for  a phenomenon  we  should  prefer the  simplest  which  describes  the  data  sufficiently  well.",

Architectural parameters of the approach, such as distance metrics, are  also localized and become a function of the query point instead of being global.  Statistical tests are given for  when a local model is good enough and sampling  should be moved to a new area. Our methods explicitly deal with the case where  prediction accuracy requirements exist during exploration: By gradually shifting  a \"center of exploration\" and controlling the speed of the  shift with local pre(cid:173) diction accuracy, a goal-directed exploration of state space takes place along the  fringes  of the current data support until  the task goal is achieved. We illustrate  this  approach  with  simulation results  and results  from  a real  robot learning  a  complex juggling task.",

        "ABSTRACT": "We investigate a model for neural activity that generates long range  temporal correlations, 1/ f  noise, and oscillations in global activity.

Each  neuron  is  independently  driven  by  homogeneous  external  noise.  Spontaneous  symmetry  breaking occurs,  resulting in  the formation of \"hotspots\"  of activ(cid:173) ity in  the  network.

In this compact representation we largely remove the redundancy of  the script,  while  preserving  most of its intelligible components.  In  the second  phase these  control sequences  are used  to train adaptive  probabilistic acyclic automata (PAA) for the important ingredients  of the writing  trajectories,  e.g.  letters.  We  present  a  new  and effi(cid:173) cient  learning algorithm for such stochastic automata, and demon(cid:173) strate  its  utility  for  spotting  and  segmentation of cursive  scripts.

Moreover, it is possible to improve upon behavioral  choices  if the consequences  of executing different actions can  be  reliably predicted.

Elman \nCenter for Research on Language  Department of Cognitive Science \nUniversity of California at San Diego \nLaJolla, CA 92093-0126 U.S.A. \nelman@crl.ucsd.edu \nThe non-linear complexities of neural networks make network solutions  difficult to understand. Sanger's contribution analysis is here extended to  the  analysis  of  networks  automatically  generated  by  the  cascade(cid:173) correlation  learning  algorithm.  Because  such  networks  have  cross  connections  that supersede hidden  layers, standard analyses of hidden  unit activation patterns are insufficient. A contribution is defined as the  product of an output weight and the associated activation on the sending  unit, whether that sending unit is an input or a hidden unit,  multiplied  by  the  sign  of  the  output  target  for  the  current  input  pattern.  Intercorrelations  among contributions,  as  gleaned from  the  matrix  of  contributions  x  input  patterns,  can  be  subjected  to  principal  components analysis (PCA) to extract the main features of variation in  the  contributions.  Such  an  analysis  is  applied  to  three  problems,  continuous XOR,  arithmetic comparison, and distinguishing  between  two interlocking spirals. In all  three cases, this technique yields useful  insights  into  network  solutions  that  are  consistent  across  several  networks.",

The problem of novelty  detection  is  particular(cid:173) ly  acute  when  prior  knowledge  and  training  data only  allow  one  to  construct  an  incomplete  classification  model.  Allowance  must  be  made  in  model  design  so  that  the  classifier  will  be  robust  to  data generated  by  classes  not  included  in  the  training  phase.  For  diagnosis  applications  one  practical approach  is  to  construct  both  an  input  density  model  and  a  discriminative  class  model.  Using  Bayes'  rule  and  prior  estimates  of the  relative  likelihood  of  data  of known and unknown origin the resulting classification equations  are  straightforward.

Fortunately, the ability to learn from examples and to generalize is  not restricted to networks ofthis type. Indeed, networks where each  node implements a simple Boolean function (Boolean networks) can  be designed in such a way as to exhibit similar properties. Two  algorithms that generate Boolean networks from examples are pre(cid:173) sented.

We  describe  an  architecture,  called  DOLCE, that allows discrete  states to evolve in a net as learn(cid:173) ing  progresses.  DOLCE  consists  of a  standard  recurrent  neural  net  trained  by  gradient  descent  and  an  adaptive  clustering  technique  that quantizes  the state space.  DOLCE  is  based  on the assumption  that a  finite  set  of discrete  internal states  is  required  for  the  task,  and that the actual network state belongs  to this  set  but has been  corrupted by noise  due  to inaccuracy in the weights.  DOLCE  learns  to  recover  the discrete  state with  maximum a  posteriori  probabil(cid:173) ity  from  the  noisy  state.

        "ABSTRACT": "Reinforcement Learning methods based on approximating dynamic  programming  (DP)  are  receiving  increased  attention  due  to  their  utility  in  forming  reactive  control  policies  for  systems  embedded  in  dynamic  environments.  Environments  are  usually  modeled  as  controlled  Markov  processes,  but  when  the  environment  model  is  not known a priori,  adaptive methods are necessary.  Adaptive con(cid:173) trol methods are often classified  as being direct  or indirect.  Direct  methods directly adapt the control policy from experience,  whereas  indirect  methods adapt a  model of the controlled process and com(cid:173) pute  control  policies  based  on  the  latest  model.  Our  focus  is  on  indirect  adaptive  DP-based  methods  in  this  paper.  We  present  a  convergence  result  for  indirect  adaptive  asynchronous  value  itera(cid:173) tion algorithms for the case in which a look-up table is used to store  the  value  function.  Our  result  implies  convergence  of several  ex(cid:173) isting reinforcement  learning algorithms such as adaptive real-time  dynamic programming (ARTDP)  (Barto,  Bradtke, &  Singh,  1993)  and prioritized  sweeping  (Moore  &  Atkeson,  1993).  Although  the  emphasis  of researchers  studying DP-based reinforcement  learning  has been on direct  adaptive methods such as Q-Learning (Watkins,  1989)  and  methods  using  TD  algorithms  (Sutton,  1988),  it is  not  clear that these direct methods are preferable in practice to indirect  methods such as those  analyzed  in  this  paper.",

Its  hardware  is  based  on  our  previously  proposed  forward-inverse-relaxation  neural  network  (Wada  & Kawato,  1993).  Computationally,  its  optimization  principle  is  the  minimum  torque(cid:173) change criterion.  Regarding  the  representation level, hard constraints  satisfied by a trajectory are represented as a set of via-points extracted  from  a  handwritten  character.  Accordingly,  we  propose a  via-point  estimation  algorithm  that  estimates  via-points  by  repeating  the  trajectory formation of a character and the via-point extraction from  the  character.  In  experiments,  good  quantitative  agreement  is  found  between  human  handwriting data and the trajectories generated by  the  theory.  Finally,  we  propose  a  recognition  schema  based  on  the  movement  generation.  We  show  a  result  in  which  the  recognition  schema is applied to the handwritten character recognition and can be  extended to the phoneme timing estimation of natural speech.",

        "ABSTRACT": "The problem of learning from examples in multilayer networks is  studied within the framework of statistical mechanics. Using the  replica formalism we calculate the average generalization error of a  fully connected committee machine in the limit of a large number  of hidden units. If the number of training examples is proportional  to the number of inputs in the network, the generalization error  as a function of the training set size approaches a finite value. If  the number of training examples is proportional to the number of  weights in the network we find first-order phase transitions with a  discontinuous drop in the generalization error for both binary and  continuous weights.",

In this paper,  we discuss the nature of the time dependence currently employed in our  systems using recurrent networks (RNs) and feed-forward multi-layer  perceptrons (MLPs). In particular, we introduce local recurrences into a  MLP to produce an enhanced input representation. This is in the form  of an adaptive gamma filter and incorporates an automatic approach for  learning temporal dependencies. We have experimented on a speaker(cid:173) independent phone recognition task using the TIMIT database.

We use  simplified  neurons,  but realistic  architecture.  As  a  first  conclusion,  we  postulate  that the feature extraction performed by the antennallobe (glomeruli and  interneurons)  necessitates  central  input from  the  mushroom bodies for  fine  tuning. The central input thus  facilitates  the evolution from fuzzy  olfactory images in the glomerular layer towards more focussed  images  upon odor presentation.",

        "ABSTRACT": "Most connectionist research has focused on learning mappings from  one space to another (eg.  classification and regression).  This paper  introduces  the  more  general  task  of learning  constraint  surfaces.  It describes  a  simple  but  powerful  architecture  for  learning  and  manipulating  nonlinear  surfaces  from  data.  We  demonstrate  the  technique  on low dimensional synthetic surfaces  and compare it to  nearest  neighbor  approaches.  We  then  show  its  utility in learning  the space of lip images in a system for improving speech recognition  by lip  reading.  This learned  surface  is  used  to improve the visual  tracking  performance during recognition. \n1  Surface Learning \nMappings  are  an  appropriate representation for  systems  whose  variables  naturally  decompose into \"inputs\"  and  \"outputs)).  To use  a learned mapping, the input vari(cid:173) ables must be known and error-free and a single output value must be estimated for  each input.  Many tasks in vision, robotics,  and control must maintain relationships  between  variables  which  don't  naturally  decompose  in  this  way.  Instead,  there  is  a  nonlinear  constraint  surface  on  which  the  values  of the  variables  are  jointly re(cid:173) stricted to lie.  We propose a representation for such surfaces  which supports a wide  range of queries  and which  can  be  naturally learned from  data. \nThe simplest queries are \"completion queries)).  In these queries, the values of certain  variables  are  specified  and  the  values  (or  constraints  on  the  values)  of remaining",

        "ABSTRACT": "Spotting tasks require detection of target patterns from a background of  richly varied non-target inputs. The performance measure of interest for  these  tasks,  called  the figure  of merit (FOM),  is  the  detection  rate  for  target  patterns  when  the  false  alarm  rate  is  in  an  acceptable  range.  A  new approach to training spotters is presented which computes the FOM  gradient  for  each  input pattern  and  then  directly  maximizes  the  FOM  using  b ackpropagati on.  This  eliminates  the  need  for  thresholds  during  training. It also  uses  network resources  to model  Bayesian a posteriori  probability  functions  accurately  only  for  patterns  which  have  a  significant effect on  the  detection accuracy over the  false  alarm rate of  interest.  FOM  training  increased  detection  accuracy  by  5  percentage  points for a hybrid radial basis function  (RBF) - hidden Markov model  (HMM) wordspotter on the credit-card speech corpus.",

        "ABSTRACT": "An autoencoder network uses a set of recognition weights to convert an  input vector into a code vector.  It then uses a set of generative weights to  convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input  vector.  We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based  on the  Minimum  Description Length  (MDL)  principle.  The aim  is  to  minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and  the reconstruction error.  We  show  that this information  is  minimized  by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distri(cid:173) bution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible  code vector given  the input vector.  Unfortunately,  if the code vectors  use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute  this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors.  We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can  be used to  compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this ap(cid:173) proximation gives an upper bound on the description length.  Even when  this bound is poor,  it can  be used  as a  Lyapunov function for learning  both the generative and the recognition weights.  We  demonstrate that  this approach can be used to learn factorial codes.",

        "ABSTRACT": "Airline  companies  usually  schedule  their flights  and  crews  well  in  advance  to optimize  their  crew  pools  activities.  Many  events such  as  flight  delays or  the  absence  of a  member require  the  crew  pool  rescheduling team to change the initial schedule  (rescheduling).  In  this paper, we  show  that the neural network comparison paradigm  applied  to  the  backgammon  game  by  Tesauro  (Tesauro  and  Se(cid:173) jnowski,  1989)  can  also  be applied  to the rescheduling  problem of  an  aircrew  pool.  Indeed  both  problems  correspond  to  choosing  the best solut.ion  from a set of possible ones without ranking them  (called here best choice problem).  The paper explains from a math(cid:173) ematical point of view  the architecture and the learning strategy of  the backpropagation neural network used for  the best  choice  prob(cid:173) lem.  We  also  show  how  the learning  phase  of the  network  can  be  accelerated.  Finally  we  apply  the  neural  network  model  to some  real rescheduling  problems for  the  Belgian  Airline  (Sabena).",

        "ABSTRACT": "A new neural network, the Binary Diamond, is presented and its use  as  a classifier is  demonstrated and evaluated. The network  is  of the  feed-forward  type.  It learns  from  examples  in  the 'one shot'  mode,  and recruits new neurons as needed. It was tested on the problem of  pixel classification, and performed well.  Possible applications of the  network in associative memories are outlined. \n1 \nINTRODUCTION:  CLASSIFICATION  BY  CLUES \nClassification  is  a  process  by  which  an  item  is  assigned  to  a  class.  Classification  is  widely  used  in  the  animal  kingdom.  Identifying  an  item  as  food  is  classification.  Assigning  words  to  objects,  actions,  feelings,  and  situations  is  classification.  The  purpose  of  this  work  is  to  introduce  a  new  neural  network,  the  Binary  Diamond,  which  can  be  used  as  a  general  purpose  classification  tool.  The  design  and  operational  mode  of  the  Binary  Diamond  are  influenced  by  observations  of  the  underlying  mechanisms that take place in  human classification  processes. \nAn item to be classified consists of basic features. Any arbitrary combination of basic  features will be called a clue. Generally, an item will consist of many clues. Clues  are  related not only to  the items which  contain them, but  also  to the classes.  Each class,  that resides in the memory, has a list of clues which are associated with it. These clues",

        "ABSTRACT": "The Minimum Description Length principle (MDL) can be used to  train the hidden units of a neural network to extract a representa(cid:173) tion that is cheap to describe but nonetheless allows the input to  be reconstructed accurately. We show how MDL can be used to  develop highly redundant population codes. Each hidden unit has  a location in a low-dimensional implicit space. If the hidden unit  activities form a bump of a standard shape in this space, they can  be cheaply encoded by the center ofthis bump. So the weights from  the input units to the hidden units in an autoencoder are trained  to make the activities form a standard bump. The coordinates of  the hidden units in the implicit space are also learned, thus allow(cid:173) ing flexibility, as the network develops a discontinuous topography  when presented with different input classes. Population-coding in  a space other than the input enables a network to extract nonlinear  higher-order properties of the inputs. \nMost existing unsupervised learning algorithms can be understood using the Min(cid:173) imum Description Length (MDL) principle (Rissanen, 1989). Given an ensemble  of input vectors, the aim of the learning algorithm is to find a method of coding  each input vector that minimizes the total cost, in bits, of communicating the input  vectors to a receiver. There are three terms in the total description length: \n• The code-cost is the number of bits required to communicate the code \nthat the algorithm assigns to each input vector.",

However,  general  dynamic  programming is  computationally intractable.  We  have  developed  procedures that allow more complex planning and control problems  to  be  solved.  We  use  second  order  local  trajectory  optimization  to  generate  locally  optimal  plans  and  local  models  of  the  value  function  and its derivatives.  We  maintain global consistency of the  local  models  of the  value  function,  guaranteeing  that  our  locally  optimal plans are actually globally optimal, up  to the resolution of  our search  procedures. \nLearning to  do the right thing at each  instant in situations that evolve over  time is  difficult,  as  the future  cost  of actions chosen  now  may not be obvious immediately,  and  may only  become  clear  with  time.  Value  functions  are  a  representational  tool  that  makes  the  consequences  of actions  explicit.  Value  functions  are  difficult  to  learn  directly,  but they  can  be built up from  learned  models of the dynamics of the  world  and  the  cost  function.  This  paper focuses  on  how  fast  optimizers  that  only  produce  locally optimal answers  can  playa useful  role  in  speeding  up  the  process  of computing or learning a globally optimal value function.

In contrast  to constructive and destructive algorithms, GNARL employs a popula(cid:173) tion of networks and uses a fitness  function's  unsupervised feedback to  guide  search  through  network  space.  Annealing  is  used  in  generating  both  gaussian  weight  changes  and  structural  modifications.

        "AUTHORS": "Klaus Obermayer, Lynne Kiorpes, Gary G. Blasdel",
        "ABSTRACT": "Maps of orientation preference and ocular dominance were recorded  optically from the cortices of 5 infant macaque monkeys, ranging in  age from 3.5 to 14 weeks.  In agreement with previous observations,  we  found  that basic features  of orientation and ocular  dominance  maps, as well  as correlations between them, are present  and robust  by  3.5  weeks  of age.  We  did  observe  changes  in  the  strength  of  ocular dominance signals, as  well  as  in the spacing of ocular dom(cid:173) inance bands, both of which  increased steadily between  3.5 and  14  weeks  of age.  The  latter  finding  suggests  that  the  adult  spacing  of ocular dominance bands depends on cortical growth in  neonatal  animals.  Since  we  found  no  corresponding  increase  in  the spacing  of orientation  preferences,  however,  there  is  a  possibility  that  the  orientation preferences  of some cells  change as  the cortical surface  expands.  Since  correlations  between  the  patterns  of orientation  selectivity  and ocular dominance  are  present  at  an  age,  when  the  visual system is still immature, it seems more likely that  their  de(cid:173) velopment may be an innate process and may not require extensive  visual experience.",

        "ABSTRACT": "One of the advantages of supervised learning is that the final  error met(cid:173) ric is available during training.  For classifiers, the algorithm can directly  reduce  the  number  of misclassifications  on  the  training  set.  Unfortu(cid:173) nately, when modeling human learning or constructing classifiers for au(cid:173) tonomous  robots,  supervisory  labels  are  often  not available  or  too  ex(cid:173) pensive.  In this paper we show that we can  substitute for  the labels by  making use of structure between the pattern distributions to different sen(cid:173) sory modalities.  We show that minimizing the disagreement between the  outputs of networks processing patterns from these different modalities is  a sensible approximation to minimizing the number of misclassifications  in each modality, and leads to similar results.  Using the Peterson-Barney  vowel  dataset we show  that the  algorithm performs well  in finding  ap(cid:173) propriate placement for the codebook vectors particularly when the con(cid:173) fuseable classes are different for the two modalities.",

We  demonstrate a  viable  alternative by training networks to evaluate Go positions via tem(cid:173) poral difference (TD)  learning.  Our approach  is  based  on network architectures  that reflect  the  spatial organization of both  input and  reinforcement  signals on  the  Go  board,  and  training  protocols  that  provide  exposure  to  competent (though unlabelled)  play.  These  techniques yield  far  better performance than undifferentiated networks trained by self(cid:173) play alone.

Complete knowledge of the output of a neural net for  arbitrary inputs  uniquely specifies  the architecture,  weights and thresholds;  and 2.  There  are  only  finitely  many  critical  points  on  the  error  surface  for  a  generic  training problem. \nNeural  nets  were  originally  introduced  as  highly  simplified  models  of the  nervous  system.  Today  they  are  widely  used  in  technology  and  studied  theoretically  by  scientists  from  several  disciplines.  However,  they  remain little understood.  Mathematically, a  (feed-forward)  neural  net  consists  of: \n(1)  A  finite  sequence  of positive integers  (Do, D 1 ,  ... ,  D£);  (2)  A family of real numbers (wJ d  defined for 1 :5 e 5:  L,  1 5:  j  5:  D l ,  1 5:  k :5  Dl-l ; \nand \n(3)  A family of real  numbers  (OJ)  defined  for  15: f 5:  L,  15: j  5:  Dl. \nThe sequence  (Do,  D 1 ,  .. \"  DL )  is  called the  architecture of the neural net, while the  W]k  are called  weights and  the  OJ  thresholds.

When tested on both a development set  and an independent test set, the resulting neural net system alone yielded a per(cid:173) fonnance at the level of the HMM system, and the hybrid SNN/HMM system  achieved a consistent 10-15% word error reduction over the HMM system.

Previously we have shown how the discrete time \"Elman\" network  algorithm can be implemented in a network completely described  by continuous ordinary differential equations. The time steps (ma(cid:173) chine cycles) of the system are implemented by rhythmic variation  (clocking) of a bifurcation parameter.

Only synchronized modules communicate by exchang(cid:173) ing amplitude information; the activity of non-resonating modules  contributes incoherent crosstalk noise.  Attentional control is modeled as a special subset of the hidden  modules with ouputs which affect the resonant frequencies of other  hidden modules.

We  present  here  an  efficient,  Bayesian  algo(cid:173) rithm for modeling a signal composed of the superposition of brief,  Poisson-distributed functions.  This methodology is  applied  to  the  specific  problem  of modeling  and  classifying  extracellular  neural  waveforms which  are  composed  of a  superposition of an  unknown  number of action potentials CAPs).  Previous  approaches have had  limited success due largely to the problems of determining the spike  shapes,  deciding  how  many  are  shapes  distinct,  and  decomposing  overlapping APs.  A  Bayesian solution to each of these problems is  obtained  by inferring  a  probabilistic model of the  waveform.  This  approach quantifies the uncertainty of the form and number of the  inferred  AP  shapes  and  is  used  to  obtain  an  efficient  method  for  decomposing  complex overlaps.  This algorithm can extract  many  times  more  information than  previous methods  and facilitates  the  extracellular  investigation of neuronal  classes  and  of interactions  within neuronal  circuits.",

How(cid:173) ever, the statistics of the fluctuations in the local activities may  be an important testing ground for comparison between models  and observed cortical dynamics. We evaluated the neuronal cor(cid:173) relation functions in a stochastic network comprising of excitatory  and inhibitory populations. We show that when the network is in  a stationary state, the cross-correlations are relatively weak, i.e.,  their amplitude relative to that of the auto-correlations are of or(cid:173) der of 1/ N, N being the size of the interacting population. This  holds except in the neighborhoods of bifurcations to nonstationary  states. As a bifurcation point is approached the amplitude of the  cross-correlations grows and becomes of order 1 and the decay time(cid:173) constant diverges. This behavior is analogous to the phenomenon  of critical slowing down in systems at thermal equilibrium near a  critical point. Near a Hopf bifurcation the cross-correlations ex(cid:173) hibit damped oscillations.",

        "AUTHORS": "Kevin R. Farrell, Richard J. Mammone",
        "ABSTRACT": "A new classifier is presented for text-independent speaker recognition. The  new classifier is called the modified neural tree network (MNTN). The  NTN is a hierarchical classifier that combines the properties of decision  trees and feed-forward neural networks. The MNTN differs from the stan(cid:173) dard NTN in that a new learning rule based on discriminant learning  is used, which minimizes the classification error as opposed to a norm  of the approximation error. The MNTN also uses leaf probability mea(cid:173) sures in addition to the class labels. The MNTN is evaluated for several  speaker identification experiments and is compared to multilayer percep(cid:173) trons (MLPs) , decision trees, and vector quantization (VQ) classifiers. The  VQ classifier and MNTN demonstrate comparable performance and per(cid:173) form significantly better than the other classifiers for this task. Addition(cid:173) ally, the MNTN provides a logarithmic saving in retrieval time over that  of the VQ classifier. The MNTN and VQ classifiers are also compared  for several speaker verification experiments where the MNTN is found to  outperform the VQ classifier.",

        "ABSTRACT": "This study explores the extent to which a network that learns the  temporal relationships within and between the component features of  Western tonal music can account for music theoretic and psychological  phenomena such as the tonal hierarchy and rhythmic expectancies.  Predicted and generated sequences were recorded as the representation of  a 153-note waltz melody was learnt by a predictive, recurrent network.  The network learned transitions and relations between and within pitch  and timing components: accent and duration values interacted in the  development of rhythmic and metric structures and, with training, the  network developed chordal expectancies in response to the activation of  individual tones. Analysis of the hidden unit representation revealed  that musical sequences are represented as transitions between states in  hidden unit space.",

        "ABSTRACT": "I  propose a learning algorithm for  learning hierarchical  models  for ob(cid:173) ject recognition.  The  model  architecture  is  a  compositional  hierarchy  that  represents  part-whole relationships:  parts  are  described  in  the lo(cid:173) cal  context of substructures  of the  object.  The  focus  of this  report  is  inducing  the  structure  of  learning  hierarchical  models  from  data,  i.e.  model  prototypes from  observed exemplars of an  object.  At each  node  in the hierarchy, a probability distribution governing its parameters must  be learned.  The connections between  nodes reflects  the structure of the  object.  The  formulation of substructures  is  encouraged  such  that  their  parts  become  conditionally  independent.  The  resulting  model  can  be  interpreted  as  a  Bayesian  Belief Network  and  also  is  in  many  respects  similar to the stochastic visual grammar described by Mjolsness.",

The model consists of four stages: (1)  extraction of local spatial frequency, (2) frequency characterization, (3)  detection of texture compression by normalization, and (4) integration  of the normalized frequency over space. The model accounts for a  number of psychophysical observations including experiments based on  novel random textures. These textures are generated from white noise  and manipulated in Fourier domain in order to produce specific  frequency spectra. Simulations with a range of stimuli, including real  images, show qualitative and quantitative agreement with human  perception.",
